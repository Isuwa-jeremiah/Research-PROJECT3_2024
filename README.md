A Neural Network-based Prediction of Later Occurrence of Breast Cancer Metastasis in an Imbalanced Data Setting

Abstract. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) poses a significant global health concern, with increasing incidence rates, notably in regions like Nigeria. Despite advancements in diagnosis and prognosis, challenges persist in accurately predicting MBC, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets. This study introduces a neural network-based model for MBC prediction, integrating feature importance measures (FIM) such as the chi-square filter, Jaya algorithm wrapper, and gini-index random forest embedded, alongside data imbalance handling techniques including oversampling (ROS), undersampling (RUS), and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Initially, FIM methods were employed to select the top 10 features from a pool of 24 in a 5-year MBC dataset before passing to the neural network, with the chi-square consistently demonstrating superior performance in accuracy, F1-score, and sensitivity. Subsequently, RUS, ROS, and SMOTE were applied to balance the selected dataset subsets, including all features. Extensive experiments revealed that utilizing all features with SMOTE consistently yielded superior performance across all metrics with significant margins, highlighting the importance of comprehensive FIM strategies and holistic data imbalance handling methods for enhancing BCM prediction accuracy.
